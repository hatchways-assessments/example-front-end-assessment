# Matching Game Challenge

Hello, and thanks for your interest in joining our company. The purpose of this challenge is to replicate a real-world working environment and to test a diverse set of skills, to see how you would work with us on our team. The challenge itself is similar to the work you would be doing on our team.

The assessment is untimed, but it is designed to take 90 min to complete (60 min coding, 30 min written discussion).

Below is some high level detail about the project. Good luck!

## The Challenge

This repo contains a boilerplate matching game built in React + Typescript. Your task is to make it actually functional. The desired features are:

1. After clicking two cards, if the cards match then keep them visible, if the cards do not match then hide the cards.
2. Add a "turns" counter for tracking how many attempts were made to complete the game. A turn is considered flipping a pair of cards.
3. Add a "You Won" message after completing all the matches.

### Written Discussion

Please include the answers to the following questions in a `notes.md` file in the root directory:

- If you had more time, what additional changes would you do to make this codebase ready for production?
- Provide a brief and high level code review of the original code provided.

## Running the app

This application is based on create-react-app. For a more detailed outline of how to get the app running see [client/README.md](../client/README.md).

Make sure to run these commands in the [client](../client/) directory.

```sh
npm install # install dependencies

npm run start # run the app

npm run format # run prettier to format your code
```

## Rubric

We will be evaluating you on the following skills in this assessment:

- Meeting User Requirements: does the solution meet the requirements specified? Does it work as expected?
- UX: how is the UX of the application? Do you handle loading states or errors well?
- Code Organization: is the code organized and easy to read?
- Best Practices: do you demonstrate the best practices in React?
- Written: how well did you review the existing codebase and discuss areas for improvement?
